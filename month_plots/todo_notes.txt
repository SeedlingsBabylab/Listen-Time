##listened time notes/TODOs for mtg with sarp

### top priorities:
* missing rank info in 141 SRs across 30 files-> need to fix
 - Will fix this
* sorting out surplus time, and words outside of any regions
* definitions at the top: surplus (ask hallie and gladys)
 - eb thinks it's coded time that's NOT makeup (which is within a subregion 4/5) or extra (which is outside of a subregion but necessary to get to hour target)
  - see if script for 'outside of known types of regions' checks for surplus


### lower priority;


* my guess is some of the ‘missing’ time might be within skips given that “* Any region of any type completely nested within a skip is removed.“ but i guess we'll have to see 
 - we can check this, as we have the structure of every cha file. So we can look for nestings in suspicious files.  

* should rename skips in month 6 and 7 as something else? e.g. sixsev_skip?
 - let's revisit once other stuff is sorted out

* adding subregions to 06 and 07 (not urgent but need to do it)
 - revisit this once everytthing else is sorted out
* why is repo 2 months old on github/BergelsonLab/annot_distr?
 - There isn't a repo named annot_distr in BergelsonLab? There is listened time investigation, but we decided to move everything to where the code lives. 
 - delete old one in bergelsonlab


Once all that's squared away we can proceed with manual checks of potentially problematic files
