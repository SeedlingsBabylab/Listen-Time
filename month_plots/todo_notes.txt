##listened time notes/TODOs for mtg with sarp

* definitions at the top
 * Done
* should rename skips in month 6 and 7 as something else? e.g. sixsev_skip?
 * Need more info for this. 
* link to script that implements counting rules for 8-13
 * Done
* my guess is some of the ‘missing’ time might be within skips given that “* Any region of any type completely nested within a skip is removed.“ but i guess we'll have to see 
* adding subregions to 06 and 07 (not urgent but need to do it)
 * Need more info for this.
* why is repo 2 months old on github/BergelsonLab/annot_distr?
 * There isn't a repo named annot_distr in BergelsonLab? There is listened time investigation, but we decided to move everything to where the code lives. 
* doublecheck 45_10 and 21_14 audio .wav length; should be < 6hours
 * Checked both of them from pn-opus/Subject_Files
 * 45_10 is 5 hours 18 minutes 31 seconds
 * 21_14 is 5 hours 30 minutes 20 seconds
* missing rank info in 141 SRs across 30 files-> need to fix

Once all that's squared away we can proceed with manual checks of potentially problematic files
