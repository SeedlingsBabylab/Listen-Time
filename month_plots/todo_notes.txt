##listened time notes/TODOs for mtg with sarp

* definitions at the top
* should rename skips in month 6 and 7 as something else? e.g. sixsev_skip?
* link to script that implements counting rules for 8-13
* my guess is some of the ‘missing’ time might be within skips given that “* Any region of any type completely nested within a skip is removed.“ but i guess we'll have to see 
* adding subregions to 06 and 07 (not urgent but need to do it)
* why is repo 2 months old on github/BergelsonLab/annot_distr?
* doublecheck 45_10 and 21_14 audio .wav length; should be < 6hours
* missing rank info in 141 SRs across 30 files-> need to fix

Once all that's squared away we can proceed with manual checks of potentially problematic files
